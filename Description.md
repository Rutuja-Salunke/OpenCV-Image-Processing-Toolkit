## 1. Image Blurring

The script `image_blurring.py` showcases different blurring techniques using OpenCV. It includes Gaussian blur, median blur, and bilateral blur.

### How to Run

```bash
python image_blurring.py
```

---

## 2. Image Resizing

The script `image_resizing.py` demonstrates image resizing using OpenCV. It includes resizing to half, a custom size, and using different interpolation methods.

### How to Run

```bash
python image_resizing.py
```

---

## 3. Grayscaling of Image

The script `grayscale_conversion.py` converts a color image to grayscale using OpenCV.

### How to Run

```bash
python grayscale_conversion.py
```

---

## 4. Image Pyramid

The script `image_pyramid.py` generates an image pyramid using the pyrDown function in OpenCV.

### How to Run

```bash
python image_pyramid.py
```

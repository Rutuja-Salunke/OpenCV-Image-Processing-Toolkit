# 🖼️ Image Processing with OpenCV in Python

This repository contains Python code snippets for basic image processing tasks using the OpenCV library. The provided code demonstrates techniques such as image blurring, resizing, grayscale conversion, and image pyramid creation.

## 📋 Table of Contents

1. [Image Blurring](#image-blurring)
2. [Image Resizing](#image-resizing)
3. [Grayscaling of Image](#grayscaling-of-image)
4. [Image Pyramid](#image-pyramid)

## 1. Image Blurring

The script `image_blurring.py` showcases different blurring techniques using OpenCV. It includes Gaussian blur, median blur, and bilateral blur.

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python image_blurring.py
```

## 2. Image Resizing

The script `image_resizing.py` demonstrates image resizing using OpenCV. It includes resizing to half, a custom size, and using different interpolation methods.

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python image_resizing.py
```

## 3. Grayscaling of Image

The script `grayscale_conversion.py` converts a color image to grayscale using OpenCV.

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python grayscale_conversion.py
```

## 4. Image Pyramid

The script `image_pyramid.py` generates an image pyramid using the pyrDown function in OpenCV.

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python image_pyramid.py
```
